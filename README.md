# Optimizing Supply Chain Efficiency in the Fashion and Beauty Industry

## Project Overview
This project analyzes supply chain data from a **Fashion and Beauty startup** to uncover insights that optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. The analysis is conducted using **Power BI**, focusing on key aspects such as inventory management, logistics, and supplier performance.

## Objectives
- **Identify bottlenecks** in supply chain operations.
- **Improve product availability** and inventory management.
- **Reduce lead times** and shipping costs.

## Dataset
The dataset contains **comprehensive supply chain data for makeup products**, including:
- **Product Information:** Product Type, SKU, Price, Availability, Number of products sold, Revenue generated
- **Customer Insights:** Customer demographics
- **Inventory & Logistics:** Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities, Shipping times, Shipping carriers, Shipping costs
- **Supplier Data:** Supplier name, Location, Lead time, Production volumes, Manufacturing lead time, Manufacturing costs
- **Quality & Transportation:** Inspection results, Defect rates, Transportation modes, Routes, Costs

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning:** Used Power Query to handle missing values, outliers, and incomplete rows.
- **Data Validation:** Ensured data consistency, eliminated duplicates, and fixed discrepancies using Power Query profiling.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trend Analysis:** Used line charts, bar graphs, and area charts to analyze sales, stock, and customer behavior.
- **Relationship Analysis:** Utilized scatter plots and heatmaps to identify correlations between lead times, costs, and defects.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Highlighted outliers in shipping times and defect rates using conditional formatting.

### 3. Modeling and Analytics
- **Forecasting:** Leveraged Power BIâ€™s forecasting tools for demand and lead time predictions.
- **Segmentation:** Grouped suppliers/customers using "Group By" and DAX functions.

### 4. Visualization and Reporting
- **Dashboards:** Created interactive dashboards to track KPIs with slicers and dynamic measures.
- **Visual Insights:** Used tree maps, waterfall charts, and geographical maps for a comprehensive view.

## Key Insights & Outcomes
1. **Revenue Insights:** Identified top-performing and underperforming products to optimize focus and strategies.
2. **Inventory Management:** Determined optimal stock levels to prevent stockouts and overstocking.
3. **Logistics Efficiency:** Highlighted cost-effective transportation modes and routes, minimizing delays and shipping costs.
4. **Supplier Performance:** Identified suppliers causing delays or defects, aiding in performance improvement and negotiations.

## Power BI Dashboards
- **Inventory Analysis Dashboard**: Displays stock levels, lead times, and product availability.
- **Shipping Analysis Dashboard**: Highlights shipping costs, routes, and carrier efficiency.
- **Supplier Performance Dashboard**: Analyzes supplier delays, defect rates, and performance trends.

## Conclusion & Future Scope
- This project provides actionable insights to optimize the supply chain for the startup, leading to **cost savings and enhanced customer satisfaction**.
- Future enhancements include:
  - **Incorporating real-time supply chain data** for dynamic decision-making.
  - **Extending the analysis** to other product categories or regions.
